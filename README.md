Step 1: Cloning and Opening the Repository :-

Opened the cloned repository in Vs Code editor.

Step 2: In this Repository I have tried to Solve Several Issues :-

a) Display Total Number of Orders in Header:
In the header component, updated the title to display the total number of orders from the data.

b) Display Order Submitted Date:
Loaded the timestamp data from src/assets/timeStamps.json and combined it with the order data. Then, displayed the order submitted date in the table.

c) Display Currency Value in Order Volume:
Updated the order volume cell to display the selected currency value from the dropdown.

d) Added Search Feature:
Implemented a search feature using the search bar in the header. Filter the orders based on the entered order ID.

e) Cleared Console Errors and Warnings
